First of all thanks!

All contributions will be accepted for the material under this [source](source) folder: the markdown document 
meant to be viewed by the tutorial audience will be generated from the [html page](source/tutorial-english.html) contained under [source](source).

The code of the presented module is purposefully extremely simple: I do not plan to change it.

On the other hand every correction in the testing process, or in the git phase will be welcome.

Markdown is not rendered always as I intended (even if the html is correct): it has some weird rendering in the [tutorial-english.md](../tutorial/tutorial-english.md)

As English not my mother tongue, any English correction will be welcome too.

Translations will be gladly accepted.
