First of all thanks!

All contributions will be accepted for the material under this [source](source) folder: the markdown document 
meant to be viewed by tutorial audience will be generated from the [html page](source/tutorial-english.html) contained under [source](source).

The code of the module presented is by choice extremely simple: I do not plan to change it.

By other hand every correction in the testing process, or in the git phase will be welcome.

Being english not my mother tongue language, any english correction will be welcome too.

Transaltions will be gladly accepted.
